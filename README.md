# OCaml-libmpdclient

This is an attempt to write a library in order to access to the mpd server.
This lib is based on the mpd protocol ([specifications](https://www.musicpd.org/doc/protocol/)).
Later it should be inspired by the C [libmpdclient](https://www.musicpd.org/libs/libmpdclient/) and its organisation.
